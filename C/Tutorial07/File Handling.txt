In C, you can create, open, read, and write to files by declaring a pointer of type FILE

FILE *fptr;           // FILE is basically a data type, need to create a pointer variable to work with it
fptr = fopen(filename, mode);

mode =>    w - Writes to a file
           a - Appends new data to a file
           r - Reads from a file
